<p id="visible">Before I start talking about the various characters, I just want to let you know that there is not enough translated (or just publicly available) information to list every character’s attacks.  In fact, the full move lists are too large to replicate here, as many attacks have various variations and follow ups.  To see the full move lists for the currently playable characters, go to the Japanese Pokkén Tournament website, and enter the section marked “Pokémon”.  Once there, go to a character’s page.  You will see the smallest version of that character’s list on that page.  Above their character portrait, there are two PDF links.  The one with a green and yellow arrow on it takes you to a medium-sized move list that explains the character’s play style, and imparts the highlights of the character’s movelist, as well as a couple of combos.  Rather appropriately, this is called the “First Guide”, and is meant to inform beginners who just want to try out characters.
<br/><br/>Beginner or not however, you really should see the full list of attacks.  The PDF link with no arrow and a longer title gives you that character’s full move list, and you may be surprised when you see the size of the average one.  The full lists contain quite a few elements and they are hard-coded in Japanese, so I will provide you with what I have deduced from them.  The letters beside attack names indicate whether they are regular attacks (N), counter attacks (B), grabs (T), or something else (no letter, usually indicating a status buff).  There are symbols that look like blue or red squares with arrows around them in the headings of some sections.  The blue symbol means that moves underneath it are only available in the Field Phase, and the red symbol means the same thing for the Duel Phase.  No symbol means the techniques listed are universally available in both phases.
<br/><br/>Now, the coloured sections are where the moves are actually listed.  On the left side is the name and command to perform the attack, and on the right side are any notable properties the attack has, like being step or jump cancelable.  The green section only states the name of the Burst Attack and any special properties it might have.  The red section lists the four special moves that the Pokémon knows, and any variations they have.  These are mostly universal moves that are tied to the A button, but some are specific to certain phases and others have follow-ups with other buttons, so watch out.  The blue section shows the universal button combinations for that Pokémon and various normal attacks and automatic combos.  These sections are often almost entirely segregated into unique movesets for both the Field Phase and the Duel Phase.  Pink sections probably list the attacks that entering Burst Mode modifies.  These modifications range from increased range to previously uncancellable attacks becoming cancellable, so even if you don’t know Japanese, look for buttons in the far right side of the section.  Finally, the yellow section provides a few basic combos.  I say “basic” because there are often combos discovered by the players that require strict timing and knowledge of the number of frames an attack takes to complete and recover.  Some attacks in Pokkén deal as much damage as a full combo if used correctly, so combo memorization is less important in this game than in other fighters.

<br/>Style:  Technique
<br/>Specials:
<br/>A:  Shadow Ball (Hold to Charge)
<br/>A + Forward:  Hypnosis
<br/>A + Back:  Shadow Punch
<br/>A + Down (Duel Phase):  Curse
<br/>Gengar was revealed as the winner of the Twitter campaign to find the most requested Pokémon for the game (it actually came in second place, but Magnemite simply would not have worked as a playable character), and was introduced several months before the arcade release.  Gengar is a tricky character that can teleport, use Shadow Ball, and perform other ghostly attacks.  Its Burst Mode involves it Mega-Evolving.  Its Burst Attack is unique in that it is unblockable.<br/>

<br/>Specials:
<br/>A X X X:  Agility ~ Fury Swipes
<br/>A + Y:  Agility ~ Fake Out

<br/>

<br/>Style:  Power
<br/>Specials:
<br/>A:  Flamethrower
<br/>Forward + A:  Fire Punch
<br/>A (Mid-Air):  Flare Blitz

<br/>Charizard was revealed as one of the last Pokémon before release shortly before the game came out.  It is a Power focused Pokémon, using its Fire-type attacks such as Flamethrower and Flare Blitz, as well as Seismic Toss.  Even though it has an extremely high damage output, it is still the first Pokémon in the game with a limited flying ability.  Its Burst Mode involves it Mega-Evolving into Mega Charizard X.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Blaziken
<br/>Style:  Standard
<br/>Specials:  Untranslated
<br/>Blaziken was first announced for Pokkén Tournament on the launch day of the arcade game, though it was teased in the initial ten-second short video alongside Lucario.  Blaziken was added to the game a month after it came out.  Its Burst Mode activates its Mega Evolution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Pikachu Libre
<br/>Style:  Speed
<br/>Specials:  Untranslated
<br/>Pikachu Libre/Masked Pikachu was revealed as part of the announcement of the Wii U version of the game, and was added to the arcade version shortly afterwards.  It has a different moveset than the standard Pikachu, focusing on grabs and singular melee strikes.  This specific Pikachu is female, and is much more cheerful than the other Pikachu.  She is just trying to please the crowd, like any good wrestler.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Sceptile
<br/>Style:  Unknown, probably Speed
<br/>Specials:  Unknown
<br/>Sceptile was first announced for Pokkén Tournament in December 2015 as part of a promotion for the game on Twitter.  It will be added in a couple of days.  It is the fastest non-Legendary Grass type Pokémon, so the developers made it very ninja-like.  Its Burst Mode activates its Mega Evolution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Shadow Mewtwo
<br/>Style:  Unknown
<br/>Specials:  Unknown
<br/>Shadow Mewtwo was secretly added as an Extra Battle boss in the arcade version of Pokkén Tournament some time in October 2015, following the update to version J04.  In the Nintendo Direct on November 12th 2015, it was confirmed that Shadow Mewtwo was going to be a playable character.  As with most boss characters, there are requirements to unlock it in the console version.  If the purchased game is a first production run copy, it will come with an amiibo card that unlocks Shadow Mewtwo instantly.  It seems to be corrupted by a yellow crystal of some sort, and is controlled by a mysterious hooded figure.  Its Burst Mode involves it Mega-Evolving into Mega Shadow Mewtwo X.  It is always in Burst Mode when fought as a boss.
