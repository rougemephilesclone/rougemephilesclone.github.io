<h3>General Mechanics</h3>
<p>Pokkén Tournament is a hybrid of a 3D and 2D fighting game.  Players are attempting to reduce their opponent’s health bar to zero to win a round, and must win two rounds to achieve victory.  Battles begin in the “Field Phase”, in which Pokémon primarily use long ranged attacks and melee attacks with strong tracking to hit one another.  Certain attacks and amounts of damage will cause the battle to transition to a “Duel Phase”, in which the two combatants are locked to a single plane and receive alternate attacks that facilitate more up-close combat, more damage, and longer combos.  Holding up or down on the control pad while in Duel Phase will cause your character to enter a stance state or a prone state, from which they can use some different attacks.  Certain attacks and amounts of damage will return the battle to Field Phase.</p>
<p>The character that causes the phase shift receives a chunk of Burst meter as a reward.  Burst energy drops after attacks are performed and when they connect, and meter is also awarded if one character uses an attack type that defeats the one their opponent is using (more on that later).  When a player’s Burst meter is full, they can activate Burst Mode, temporarily modifying the properties of their attacks and giving them access to a powerful Burst Attack.  Another meter present beside the health and Burst meters is the Support gauge, which governs when a Support Pokémon can be used.  Depending on the Support Pokémon, they can attack, defend the user with an attack, bestow a positive effect on the user, or inflict a negative one on the opponent.  Support Pokémon come in sets of two, the players choosing one to use at the start of every round.  The unused Pokémon will have a full Support gauge if chosen for the next round.</p>
<p>The game lacks the high and low attack guarding systems of most fighting games because the developers wanted the game to appear like it was not too complicated.  However, the developers also decided that they needed to try and maintain a rock-paper-scissors-like system to keep the game skill-based enough to ensure that the it obtains a devoted following for the future.  They instituted a triangle of universal attack types that trump one another.  Normal attacks can be blocked, but they are usually fast enough to defeat grabbing attacks.  Grabs can pass through blocks and blocking attacks.  Blocking attacks can power though several normal attacks without significant damage, and hit the opponent for decent damage.  They can also be step-cancelled out of.  It is this system that gives Pokkén it’s strategic complexity.</p>
<h3>Controls</h3>
<p>The game is designed to use a simplified control scheme more akin to a 3D action game than a regular 2D fighting game.  The arcade controller was designed like a cross between a Super Nintendo controller and a Wii U Pro Controller.  It has six buttons (four on the face and two shoulder buttons) and a control pad.  The pad is used for movement, and can be double-tapped to dash in any direction.  This dash acts as a dodge of sorts, and can be used to cancel out of or move during certain attacks.  The L and R buttons are the shoulder buttons, and they can be used to summon Support Pokémon and Guard, respectively.  Guarding causes almost all oncoming attacks to deal no damage, but the barrier that appears will gradually turn from blue to red as it absorbs more attacks.  It will then break, stunning the user and leaving them open for attacks.  Pressing R and a direction can also cause you to sidestep.  Pressing L and R at the same time triggers Burst Mode, and pressing them together while in Burst Mode will activate the Burst Attack.  The Burst Attack can only be used once per one activation of Burst Mode.  Now, on to the face buttons!</p>
<p>The face buttons (A, B, X, and Y) are the primary buttons that one would use to fight.  The B button causes your character to jump.  This allows you to avoid attacks, and gain access to aerial attacks.  The Y and X buttons are the weak and strong attacks, respectively.  They serve as your primary method of attacking and continuing combos.  Pressing Y repeatedly during the Duel Phase will usually result in a short automatic combo.  The B button is the “special move” button.  Much like how Pokémon in the regular games can learn up to four moves at a time, each Pokémon in Pokkén knows four special moves in addition to whatever attacks come from buttons other than B.  These moves can have different variations based on whether or not you are on the ground or in the air, whether you hold or tap the button, which direction you are holding on the pad, what buttons you press after the initial input, and sometimes which phase you are in, but there are always four base moves.  Pressing Y and B together will perform a grab, and pressing X and A together will cause a block attack.
