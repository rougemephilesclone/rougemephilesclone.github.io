<p>Hello, and welcome to the Pokkén Tournament fan website!  I made this site to spread the word about Pokken, and correct and inform people about what the actual details of the game are.  Not only am I extremely excited for this “easy operation” (what I call fighting games that are deep and balanced, but lack the complex special attack inputs of most fighting games) fighting game, I want everyone to know that this game has its own unique identity.  Even though it is a Pokémon game and contains 3D movement, it is still a valid fighting game that has an easy-to-grasp strategic system that is much better than other dumbed down 3D fighters.  Not a lot of people online seem to have done as much research into this game as I have, and I want to try and quell the demeaning, incorrect comparisons to other 3D fighting games.  I hope that people will learn about the game from this site, and I hope they become more interested in it because of that knowledge.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is a Pokémon fighting game developed by Bandai Namco and published by Nintendo.  The game takes place in the Ferrum region, and consists of “Ferrum Battles” between two Pokémon controlled by their trainers.  It was released in Japanese arcades in the summer of 2015, and will be released on the Wii U worldwide in spring 2016.  Go to the “System” page for a detailed explanation of the gameplay and controls, and go to the “Characters” page for information on the move lists and playable Pokémon.
